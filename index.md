Minesweeper is a tool to detect websites infected with drive-by malware.

Shopify uses Minesweeper to protect its 100,000+ online stores from web-based malware infections.

Minesweeper deals with not only the problem of detecting the malware, but also attributing an infection back to a particular asset. It is designed for high speed, parallel operation.
